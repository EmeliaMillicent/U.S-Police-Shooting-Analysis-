# Police Shooting Incident Report Analysis (January - July 2015)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the analysis of police shooting incidents across the United States from 2015 t0 2020. The project aims to provide a data-driven overview of these incidents, highlighting key demographic trends, circumstances, and contributing factors, to foster informed discussions on law enforcement practices and public safety.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset of over 4000 police shooting incidents that occurred between 2015 to 2020. The data includes various attributes such as:

* Victim demographics (gender, race/ethnicity, age)
* Weapon involvement
* Manner of death
* Threat level posed by the individual
* Fleeing status
* Presence of mental illness indicators
* Body camera usage during the incident

*(Note: The raw dataset, if available and appropriate for public sharing, should be linked or included in the repository. For this analysis, the data was processed from an Excel file.)*

## Analysis Performed

The analysis involved:

* **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculating percentages and counts for categorical variables (gender, race, armed status, etc.) and averages for numerical data (age).
* **Distribution Analysis:** Examining the distribution of incidents across various demographic groups and incident characteristics.
* **Trend Identification:** Observing monthly trends in the number of incidents during the specified period.
* **Key Indicator Assessment:** Focusing on the prevalence of mental illness and body camera usage in reported incidents.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed several significant insights:

* **Gender:** A vast majority of victims (93.4%) were male.
* **Race/Ethnicity:** White individuals accounted for the largest proportion (51.2%), followed by Black individuals (27.8%).
* **Weapon Involvement:** Guns were present in two-thirds (66.8%) of all incidents.
* **Mental Health:** Nearly one in five victims (17.4%) showed signs of mental illness.
* **Body Camera Usage:** Body cameras were present in only a small fraction (9.9%) of incidents.
* **Fleeing Status:** The majority of individuals (68.2%) were not fleeing at the time of the incident.
* **Age:** The average age of individuals involved was approximately 35.6 years, with the 26-40 age group representing the largest segment (42.5%).

## Recommendations & Future Work

Based on these findings, the following areas warrant further attention and potential future research:

* **Mental Health Response:** Investigate and develop improved protocols for law enforcement encounters involving individuals with signs of mental illness.
* **Body Camera Implementation:** Study the impact of increased body camera adoption on incident outcomes and accountability.
* **De-escalation Training:** Review and enhance de-escalation training programs, particularly concerning scenarios where individuals are not actively fleeing.
* **Geographic Analysis:** Incorporate geographic data to identify regional patterns and systemic issues that may contribute to shooting incidents.
